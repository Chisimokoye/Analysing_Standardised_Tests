**REPORT ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE DISTRICT WIDE STANDARDIZED TEST RESULTS**


Test results from of 39,170 students across 15 schools were analysed for this report. Overall, it was observed that the pass rate for Reading was better than that of math, with a % passing of 85.81% as against 74.98% recorded in math.


The test results were further analysed by school and the of all the 15 schools analysed, Caberra High School came out tops with an overall passing percentage of 91.35%. The lowest overall performance however came from Rodriguez High school (53.28%). 


An analysis of the top performing and bottom performing schools also revealed the following:
1) Most top performing schools are Charter schools with an overall percentage of 90.42% as against their District school counterparts who had an overall pass rate of 53.76%. Charter schools are schools that operate autonomously, and their curriculum is not dictated by the state or local government. What this means is that they can tailor learning. This is reflected in the performance as results suggests that student specific issues might have been better addressed by the specially crafted curriculums. This is further revealed by the almost at par performance of the student’s in both Reading and Math for charter schools as against the obvious better performance in Reading than Math in the District schools.
2) The student’s strength of the top performing schools was generally lower than the bottom performing schools. This leads us to also assume that there is an obvious relationship between class size and performance. Students in smaller class sizes tend to have access to more hands-on learning as opposed to large classes that inherently limits this. This was also further buttressed when we analysed the performance by school size. Large schools (between 2000 to 5000 students) had an overall performance percentage of 58.37%.


While there has been an increased outcry for better spending and support for students, this report reveals that better performances were not guaranteed by amount spent on students. The report shockingly showed that the higher the spend per student the lower the performance. Students between the spending range of less than $585 had an overall performance of 90.29% as against 53.68% from students in the $645 -680 spending range. So more attention should be paid to the needs of the students as money is no a one size fits all solution to improve performance.
